Earlier, I worked on data visualization charts using other tools during my college project. Recently, I started creating visualization charts using Python, which has made the process more efficient and insightful. With libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, I can now easily explore data, create interactive and visually appealing graphs, and analyze trends or patterns more effectively. This transition has improved my understanding of both data interpretation and coding-based visualization.
I am currently working on a project (FedEx Logistics Performance Analysis) focused on data visualization using Python. The goal is to analyze data and represent key insights through clear and meaningful charts. By using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas, I am learning to clean, process, and visualize data efficiently. This project is helping me strengthen my analytical skills and understand real-world data patterns through visual storytelling.
